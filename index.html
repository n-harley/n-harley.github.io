      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        Nick Harley graduated with an MEng in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from UCL (London) in 2011, and with an MSc in Sound and Music Computing from UPF (Barcelona) in 2014. He undertook his PhD in Computer Science at QMUL (London) and defended his thesis in 2019. His PhD dissertation is in the field of computational musicology and examines formal systems for knowledge representation and reasoning in the domain of music. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the AI Lab of the VUB (Brussels) with research interests focused at the intersection of computational musicology, knowledge representation and reasoning, and computational creativity.
